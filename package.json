  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This TypeScript price calculator is designed to determine the price based on a given price table and product dimensions. Key features include finding the nearest width and height in the table based on the provided dimensions, and ultimately calculating the price based on these selected values. The calculator takes into account constraints regarding the minimum and maximum width and height, and it searches for the closest values when the provided dimensions do not precisely match the data in the table.",
